Exercise 11.1 Warming up

Language decided for this exercise is Python. From Microsofts VS Code documents google provided Pylint, flake8 and mypy extensions published by Microsoft. Going through Pylint documents cursory it seems to be quite like eslint used which was familiarized in previous chapters. For testing unittest framework was found from python.org which again sounded quite similar what we have already used in this course and if not familliar at least example test codes seem to be intuitive at this point. For building apps google suggested Anvil which should be tool for full-stack web apps made purely with Python. 

JetBrains has tool for multiplatform CI/CD, AWS has solution for pipeline and of course Microsoft with Azure. 

As said in this part's introduction, usually cloud-based environment does not require jumping through so many hoops as self-hosted. Reasons were that self-hosted requires (much) more configuration and possible boilerplate code to get system up and running while cloud-based environment is ready there, we just need to read throught the documents how can we create it work like we want to. This of course might be problematic if we want it to do some sort of black magic - company hosting cloud-based environment might not have ways to do that. If I think this project or the project after this course has completed I am certain that cloud-based environment is suitable for my needs as there is only me developing it and it is rather simple. If it would be something developed by entire team or it is complex program, it could be re-evaluated.
